# IoT-Temperature-Humidity-Based-Fan-Controller-System

## IOT SOLUTION FOR TEMPERATURE and humidity BASED FAN SPEED CONTROLER

###### In this Project we developed a temperature and humidity-based fan speed controller system. 

###### The fan's speed will be regulated by a control circuit based on the temperature, humidity, and number of humans Infront of the camera. 

###### In this event that the room temperature rises ,the fanâ€™s speed will rise based on the number of humans.

###### In our system, fan will be automatically on, when at least one human is there Infront of the camera. 

###### We planned to use a Pi camera to detect the number of humans inside the room. If there are no humas then the fan will automatically switch off. 

###### Due to different circumstances the temperature is vary in different places. As a solution we thought of develop this system using two humidity sensors adjust in two different places and control each fan according to temperature and humidity captured by each sensor.
